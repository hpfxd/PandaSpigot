Subject: [PATCH] Fix sending head rotation packet to all viewers

This code, originally introduced by CraftBukkit, sends the entity's head
rotation when it gains a new viewer. But instead of sending the packet
only to the viewer, it broadcasts it to all viewers. This can cause many
packets to be sent when an entity spawns near many players.

This patch modifies the code to send the packet only to the viewer
that the packet was meant to be delivered to.
